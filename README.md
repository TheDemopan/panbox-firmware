# Panbox MK II Firmware and Design Files
Circuit Python code for my custom gamepad

#### Code included is for my Panbox MK II
Keys included for WASD, and U, I, O, J, K, and L

Project files also include the layout yaml generated with Ergogen, you may preview it at ergogen.cache.works

The generated PCB file for KiCad is included as well, but it must be edited to include your microcontroller of choice. In my case, I used an Adafruit Feather RP2040
